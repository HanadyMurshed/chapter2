I've noticed that dealing and with stack is much easier than dealing with the scondery memory the way wwe did back in chapter 1. 
Moreover, it's much faster.
It was first challenging to referance only the last element in the stack nut it was so much fun.
I don't know but in general, I think chapter 2 was entertaining and didn't take time as much as ch1 did
The good old days when the developer used the foth language was really really good days
